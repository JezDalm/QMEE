# Description of Species
Human fungal pathogens are lethal infectious agents, particularly in immunocompromised individuals **(One Health, 2017)**. _Aspergillus fumigatus_ is a major cause of invasive aspergillosis with mortality rates reaching up to 90% **(Xu, 2022)**. Due to its prevalence, adaptability, and resistance, the World Health Organization classified _A. fumigatus_ as a “Critical Priority” pathogen **(Fan et al. 2021)**. Its small spores enable deep lung penetration, while thermotolerance, toxin production, and diverse metabolites drive pathogenicity **(Dagenais & Keller, 2009; Christians et al. 2011)**. Treatment relies on triazoles, which target synthesis of a fungal cell membrane component called ergosterol, but resistance is rising globally. Although triazole resistance mechanisms are relatively well characterized, those underlying amphotericin B (AMB) resistance remain poorly understood. AMB targets ergosterol in the cell membrane directly and triazole-resistant strains may be susceptible to AMB treatment. Further, the genetic bases of virulence and thermotolerance are only beginning to be explored **(Chowdhary et al. 2017; Verweij et al. 2016; Sen et al. 2024)**. Climate change may further promote the spread of resistant, thermotolerant strains, which allows _A. fumigatus_ to thrive and adapt at human body temperatures and warmer environments which increase the likelihood of human exposure **(Bhabhra & Askew, 2005; Korfanty et al. 2023; Fabri et al. 2021)**. While traits such as antifungal resistance, virulence, and thermotolerance have been studied individually, little is known about how genetic variation and trait interactions shape pathogenicity in _A. fumigatus_. Prior genetic mapping in _A. fumigatus_ has been restricted to single crosses and single traits, limiting resolution of complex inheritance patterns **(Auxier et al. 2023)**. 

# Description of my Dataset
My dataset consists of five sexual crosses of _A. fumigatus_ along with quantitative data on their antifungal susceptibilities, biofilm formation, hemolysin production, and growth at four different temperatures. Each cross is biparental with ~100 F1 progeny per cross. The data are calculated means from triplicates which have also been standardized based on each respective phenotype.
