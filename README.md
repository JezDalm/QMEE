# Description of Species
Human fungal pathogens are lethal infectious agents, particularly in immunocompromised individuals **(One Health, 2017)**. _Aspergillus fumigatus_ is a major cause of invasive aspergillosis with mortality rates reaching up to 90% **(Xu, 2022)**. Due to its prevalence, adaptability, and resistance, the World Health Organization classified _A. fumigatus_ as a “Critical Priority” pathogen **(Fan et al. 2021)**. Its small spores enable deep lung penetration, while thermotolerance, toxin production, and diverse metabolites drive pathogenicity **(Dagenais & Keller, 2009; Christians et al. 2011)**. Treatment relies on triazoles, which target synthesis of a fungal cell membrane component called ergosterol, but resistance is rising globally. Although triazole resistance mechanisms are relatively well characterized, those underlying amphotericin B (AMB) resistance remain poorly understood. AMB targets ergosterol in the cell membrane directly and triazole-resistant strains may be susceptible to AMB treatment. Further, the genetic bases of virulence and thermotolerance are only beginning to be explored **(Chowdhary et al. 2017; Verweij et al. 2016; Sen et al. 2024)**. Climate change may further promote the spread of resistant, thermotolerant strains, which allows _A. fumigatus_ to thrive and adapt at human body temperatures and warmer environments which increase the likelihood of human exposure **(Bhabhra & Askew, 2005; Korfanty et al. 2023; Fabri et al. 2021)**. While traits such as antifungal resistance, virulence, and thermotolerance have been studied individually, little is known about how genetic variation and trait interactions shape pathogenicity in _A. fumigatus_. Prior genetic mapping in _A. fumigatus_ has been restricted to single crosses and single traits, limiting resolution of complex inheritance patterns **(Auxier et al. 2023)**. 

# Description of my Dataset
My dataset consists of five sexual crosses of _A. fumigatus_ along with quantitative data on their antifungal susceptibilities, biofilm formation, hemolysin production, and growth at four different temperatures. Each cross is biparental with ~100 F1 progeny per cross. The data are calculated means from triplicates which have also been standardized based on each respective phenotype. I will be analyzing the "Af_J57xP20.csv" file as a biparental cross for 'Assignment 1'. The data in this file includes: **Strain, triazole types, antifungal minimum inhibtiory concentrations (ug/ml), antifungal growth optical density (OD) values at different antifungal concentrations, hemolysin production taken as zone of clearance/colony diameter (cm) across 72h, biofilm formation (OD), growth (OD) across four different temperatures (15, 22, 35, 41) across 72h, and area under the curve (AUC) for the different temperatures between 24h and 48h.** Majority of this data is quantitative and the overall goal of my project is to **identify quantitative trait loci assoicated with these traits.**

# Questions I Hope to Answer
- Are there fitness tradeoffs between triazole resistant strains compared to susceptible strains?
- Do resistant and susceptible strains cluster based on associated traits?
